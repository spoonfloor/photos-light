## Why Archived?

These documents served their purpose during active development but are no longer needed for day-to-day bug tracking. All relevant information has been:

1. ✅ Consolidated into `bugs-fixed.md` (comprehensive history)
2. ✅ Consolidated into `bugs-to-be-fixed.md` (active bug list)
3. ✅ Moved to `tech-docs/` (if technical deep-dive material)

Keep these files for historical reference, but refer to the canonical bug tracking docs in the root directory.
